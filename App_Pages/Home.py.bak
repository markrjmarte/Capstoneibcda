                        <p>We are Team Padayon, a student of Southern Leyte State Uviversity. We've been making this app to provide helful
                        tools fo the farmers havibg a hard time dealing with corn plant diseases. We're proud and pride ourselves on
                        using this app to help our farmers on what they are expecting. Our team is compose of talented people that are
                        passionate about creating such an app</p>
                        <h1 style= "color: #1293EE; font: normal 120% arial, sans-serif; padding: 20px 0 5px 0;">Our Vission</h1>
                        <p>To generate possible solution and provide a better way to distinguish corn plant diseases.</p>

                        <p>Aiming for giving a usefull web app that will help the farmer to detect corn diseases more accurately.
                        The team, hopes to create a comfortable and user friendly web app for the user that will be using it.</p>

                        <p>As of now the app can only predict the following diseases: Common Rust, Tar Spot, Eyespot, Southern Rust,Northern Corn Leaf Blight, Gray Leaf Spot</p>

                            <a><p>The Department of Agriculture (DA) is crafting a strategic and robust corn industry development roadmap 
                            to address the sectorâ€™s challenges. The existing techniques that the farmer does is identifying a gray leaf spot, 
                            northern corn leaf blight, tar spot, common and southern rust. The usual process done by a farmer is to submit a 
                            hoto of the possible disease of corn and wait for the Bureau of Plant Industry to confirm and explain what kind of 
                            disease the corn has. This usually takes time and possible disease may worsen before their feedback would be done. 
                            Without using technology, manual disease control can be a waste of time and money, and can lead to further corn losses. 
                            Moreover, knowing and detecting corn diseases as early as possible is essential for keeping your corn crop healthy and 
                            protect your yields as well. Detecting what these diseases looks like is the first step to prevent, protect and avoid 
                            losses in the quantity of corn (Bayer, 2020). 
                            <p>With the development of technology, the use of deep learning and image recognition technology for plant disease 
                            detection has become an important research direction. With this application, implementing a suitable and fast identification 
                            system with machine learning can solve the gap in identifying and classifying the wide variety of corn diseases from 
                            images of plant leaves. The identification model focused on using class labels for training images, and built a fine-grained 
                            image classification system- a recognition method for corn disease images. Hence, this application is using a novel method
                            for identifying the diseases of corn plants using their leaf images. </p></a>
