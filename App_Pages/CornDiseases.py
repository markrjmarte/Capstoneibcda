                    and the leaves total 8–21 per plant. The leaves are linear or lanceolate (lance-like) with an obvious midrib (primary vein) 
                    and can grow from 30 to 100 cm (11.8–39.4 in) in length. The male and female inflorescences (flower bearing region of the plant) a
                    re positioned separately on the plant. The male inflorescence is known as the ‘tassel’ while the female inflorescence is the ‘ear’. 
                    The ear of the maize is a modified spike and there may be 1–3 per plant. The maize grains, or ‘kernels’, are encased in husks and total 30–1000 per ear. 
                    The kernels can be white, yellow, red, purple or black. Maize is an annual plant, surviving for only one growing season and can 
                    reach 2–3 m (7–10 ft) in height.</p></a>

                    <a><p>Southern rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia polysora, which only infects corn. 
                    Pustules of southern rust are small (0.2 to 2 mm in diameter), circular to oval and light cinnamon 
                    brown to orange, they frequently form on the upper leaf surface and very rarely on the lower leaf surface 
                    (Figure 2). Southern rust pustules may occur on leaves, stalks, sheaths, and Husks. 
                    <p>Southern rust is easily overlooked by the casual observer early in the season because initial infections are typically only one to two pustules per plant
                    (Figure 1: Cycle). The absence of sporulation on the lower leaf surface early in the season is an indication of southern rust. 
                    As indicated earlier, rust sporulation on the lower leaf surface is associated with common rust, a minor disease. Early-season 
                    southern rust pustule development is most frequently observed in the field at mid-canopy (4 to 5 feet from the ground) along the edge 
                    of the field. Free moisture as dew or light rain is necessary for rust spores to germinate and infect. Symptoms appear about 3 to 6 days 
                    after infection, and by 7 to 10 days the pustules may rupture to expose more rust spores. Thus, new infections can occur very rapidly after 
                    the initial infection when conditions favor disease. Conditions that favor disease develop-ment consist of high temperatures (80° to 90°F), 
                    high relative humidity and frequent rainfall/ heavy dew. Even in hot summer conditions with temperatures above 100°F, pustules continue to 
                    sporulate, hence the name southern rust.</p></a>

                These spots are ascomatum (fungal fruiting structures). If viewed under the microscope, hundreds of sausage-shaped asci (spore cases) 
                filled with spores are visible. When severe, ascomatum can even appear on husks and leaf sheaths.Tan to brown lesions with dark borders

                susceptible hybrids may reduce tar spot development and severity. Some fungicides may also reduce tar spot, although little data exists 
                regarding application timing for efficacy and economic response (Figure 6). </p></a>

                Under moist conditions, dark gray spores are produced, usually on the lower leaf surface, which give lesions a “dirty” gray appearance. 
                Entire leaves on severely blighted plants can die, so individual lesions are not visible(Figure 8). Lesions may occur on the outer husk of ears, 
                but the kernels are not infected. On hybrids that contain an Ht gene for resistance to the fungus, lesions are smaller, chlorotic,

                <a><p>Common rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi and occurs every growing season. 
                It is seldom a concern in hybrid corn. Rust pustules usually first appear in late June. Early symptoms of common rust 
                are chlorotic flecks on the leaf surface. These soon develop into powdery, brick-red pustules as the spores break through 
                the leaf surface. Pustules are oval or elongated, about 1/8 inch long, and scattered sparsely or clustered together. 
                The leaf tissue around the pustules may become yellow or die, leaving lesions of dead tissue. The lesions sometimes form a 
                band across the leaf and entire leaves will die if severely infected. As the pustules age, the red spores turn black, so the 
                pustules appear black, and continue to erupt through the leaf surface (Figure 9). Husks, leaf sheaths, and stalks also may be infected.
                The fungus survives the winter as spores in subtropical and tropical regions; spores are carried long distances by wind and 
                eventually reach the Midwest. Rust development is favored by high humidity with night temperatures of 65-70°F and moderate daytime
